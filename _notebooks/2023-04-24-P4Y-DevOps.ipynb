    "\n",
    "AWS and Deployment, Docker, Nginx Improvements (Shaurya and Shivansh)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through this for 3-5 minutes and make sure that the class understands any updates that we made, and go through the deployment review. This is a concept that mostly everyone is already familiar with, so we won't take too much time on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are there any improvements that can be made to the current deployment guide?\n",
    "2. Is there anything unclear that we need to communicate further to the students for deployment?\n",
    "3. Are there any outdated Nginx/Docker functionalities to address?\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS Setup (Shaurya and Shivansh)\n",
    "DNS Setup incorporated with EC2. We will go more into DuckDNS, building off of what Jeffrey built. This will be presented for around 7-9 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DuckDNS Guide for Setup\n",
    "2. Explanation and Setup of DNS in terms of EC2 Deployment\n",

    "3. How are their functionalities unique to other deployment platforms?\n",
    "\n",
    "KASM on EC2 Guide (Justin and Vardaan)\n",
    "We will go through this notebook for around 7-9 minutes. This is a setup process that may take up too much time for one class period for everyone to follow along and install all the necessary features for, so we will go through it ourselves with pictures and code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can KASM on EC2 Guide be applied to our APCSP environment?\n",
    "2. What are the steps we have to go through for setup? \n",
    "3. Is this process more difficult than what is currently in place for deployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Security Certbot (Dhruva and Vyaan)\n",
    "We will go through this overview for 3-5 minutes. Mostly everyone is familiar with Certbot, but we will dive deeper with this post overview and make sure to clarify any concerns/questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the applications of Certbot in the real world?\n",
    "2. What is its application in our CSP projects?\n",
    "3. Do we need a more advanced guide on its setup?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Discovering Alternatives to Certbot (Dhruva and Vyaan)\n",
    "We will go through other alternatives to Certbot. We will explain the pros/cons of these alternatives and come to a final conclusion of which platform we should utilize for this aim, and make sure to explain our backing. This should take 5-7 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the alternatives to Certbot?\n",
    "2. What are the pros/cons to using these alternatives?\n",
    "3. Possible setup of some of these alternatives?\n",
    "\n",
    "The different types of AWS Databases (Nicolas and Prasith)\n",
    "We will go through all the different types of AWS databases. This is going to be an overview of how each of these databases work, and review the SQLite functionalities as well. This should take 5-7 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the different types of AWS Databases?\n",

    "1. What are the pros/cons of each of these AWS databases in comparison to SQLite?\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing these AWS Databases (Notebook) (Nicolas and Prasith)\n",
    "We will go through the code blocks and have a comprehensive guide on how to implement these different AWS Databases. This will be similar to the SQLite setup implementation to make it easy to understand. This should take 7-9 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we implement these AWS databases?\n",
    "2. How is this applicable in the APCSP Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**HOMEWORK/HACKS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will likely add questions within code blocks, or questions in regards to researching even more about some of the applications that we talk about (within blogs or notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also ask for a notebook where they show off some of the functionalities of an AWS DB of their choice.\n",
